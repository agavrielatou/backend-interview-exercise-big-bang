Design
------
The factory object oriented pattern has been used
for this implementation in order to create different
types of Choices (e.g. Paper, Rock, etc). Using that
pattern, the design is reusable and extensible without
repetitions. The rules of the game as described in
the exercise have been applied into the code.

Unit tests for the classes and the functions have
been added.

Run it

python3 paper_rock.py
